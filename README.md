We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards stratergies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure.

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies:

- [Terraform 0.12](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-route-table/releases).


Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### Simple set
```hcl
  module "route-table" {
    record_enabled  = true
    zone_id         = "Z2FDRFHATA1ER4"
    names           = [
                      "www.",
                      "admin."
                     ]
    types           = [
                      "A",
                      "CNAME"
                     ]
    ttls            = [
                      "3600",
                      "3600",
                     ]
    values          = [
                      "10.0.0.27",
                      "mydomain.com",
                     ]
  }
```

### Set with alias
```hcl
  module "route-table" {
    source         = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-route-table.git?ref=tags/0.12.0"
    record_enabled = true
    zone_id        = "Z2FDRFHATA1ER4"
    names          = [
                      "www.",
                      "admin."
                    ]
    types          = [
                      "A",
                      "CNAME"
                    ]
    alias          = {
                      names = [
                        "d130easdflja734js.cloudfront.net"
                      ]
                      zone_ids = [
                        "Z2FDRFHATA1ER4"
                      ]
                      evaluate_target_healths = [
                        false
                      ]
                    }
  }
```

|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| alias | An alias block. Conflicts with ttl & records. Alias record documented below. | map | `<map>` | no |
| allow_overwrites | Allow creation of this record in Terraform to overwrite an existing record, if any. This does not affect the ability to update the record in Terraform and does not prevent other resources within Terraform or manual Route 53 changes outside Terraform from overwriting this record. false by default. This configuration is not recommended for most environments. | list | `<list>` | no |
| health_check_ids | The health check the record should be associated with. | list | `<list>` | no |
| multivalue_answer_routing_policies | Set to true to indicate a multivalue answer routing policy. Conflicts with any other routing policy. | list | `<list>` | no |
| names | The name of the record. | list | `<list>` | no |
| record_enabled | Whether to create Route53 record set. | bool | `false` | no |
| set_identifiers | Unique identifier to differentiate records with routing policies from one another. Required if using failover, geolocation, latency, or weighted routing policies documented below. | list | `<list>` | no |
| ttls | (Required for non-alias records) The TTL of the record. | list | `<list>` | no |
| types | The record type. Valid values are A, AAAA, CAA, CNAME, MX, NAPTR, NS, PTR, SOA, SPF, SRV and TXT. | list | `<list>` | no |
| values | (Required for non-alias records) A string list of records. To specify a single record value longer than 255 characters such as a TXT record for DKIM, add "" inside the Terraform configuration string (e.g. "first255characters""morecharacters"). | list | `<list>` | no |
| zone_id | Zone ID. | string | `` | no |
